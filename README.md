# week-two-css-portfolio-challenge Creating a portfolio starting with code from base/scratch and making it a project 

# Things I have added to portfolio from beginning whilst creating it

- Added placeholder images
- Linked image of one piece I done to deployed application
- Added links to external websites within the HTML
- Added links within the navigation so when I click, it goes to the corresponding section I want it to go to.
- Added hover elements within the nav segment
- Resized images and applications using 'grid' and spaced cards out using margin
- Made the webpage more aesthetic to the eye and the layout of the webpage is responsive
